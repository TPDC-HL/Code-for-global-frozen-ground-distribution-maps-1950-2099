This repository contains four NCL scripts for processing CMIP6 climate model data: AFI.ncl computes Annual Freezing Index from daily temperature data; ATI.ncl computes Annual Thawing Index; Kappa\_Ft.ncl optimizes freezing thresholds using three observational datasets through Kappa coefficient validation; and Permafrost\_distribution\_data.ncl generates final permafrost distribution maps (1950-2099) for 25 CMIP6 models across four SSP scenarios, applying region-specific thresholds to classify permafrost into four categories.



Python versions of all scripts are also provided (AFI.py, ATI.py, Kappa\_Ft.py, Permafrost\_distribution\_data.py) with equivalent functionality using xarray, numpy, and matplotlib libraries.
